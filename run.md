# Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the Java code in this repository.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Oracle website.

## Running the Code

To run a particular Java file, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java file you want to run using the `cd` command.
3. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command followed by the filename. For example, if your file is named `MyProgram.java`, you would type `javac MyProgram.java`.
4. After successful compilation, run the program using the `java` command followed by the filename without the `.java` extension. For example, `java MyProgram`.

Please note that these instructions assume that you have added Java to your system's PATH variable. If not, you might need to provide the full path to the `javac` and `java` commands or add Java to your PATH.
