# Git Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up a Git repository on your local system.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Git installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official Git website.

## Setting Up a Local Repository

To set up a local Git repository, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new repository using the `cd` command.
3. Initialize a new Git repository in this directory by typing `git init`.

## Cloning an Existing Repository

If you want to clone an existing repository:

1. Copy the URL of the repository from the web page. This URL is typically located on the main page of the repository and ends in `.git`.
2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Type `git clone`, followed by the URL of the repository. For example: `git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git`.

Please note that these instructions assume that you have added Git to your system's PATH variable. If not, you might need to provide the full path to the `git` command or add Git to your PATH.
