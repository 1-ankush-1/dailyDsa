Problem Statement : -

In the realm of this quandary. Deepank wields a string S,
composed of lowercase letters from the English alphabet. This
string bears a length of N. Deepank's aspiration involves a
metamorphosis of S into an exquisite string, which shall be
christened as T. To actualize this, Deepank enlists the following
procedure to be executed upon each character within the string:
Should the character be a consonant, it shall undergo substitution
with its nearest vowel.

If the character is already a vowel, it shall remain unaltered.
In full cognizance of the variability within the resulting string T,
Deepank is immersed in contemplation. His contemplation
revolves around the tally of distinct instances of these beautiful
strings T that can be engendered through the application of the
aforementioned operations upon string S.
Given the potentially substantial scale of the answer, it is rendered
in its output after being subjected to the modulo operation with
the value 10^9+7
Note:

- There are 26 characters in the English alphabet. Five of these
  characters are vowels: a, e, i, o, and u. The remaining 21 characters
  are consonants.
- The closest vowel to a consonant is the vowel that is least
  distant from that consonant. For example, the distance between
  the characters d and e is 1 while the distance between the
  characters d and a is 3.
- The distance between the characters z and a is 25 and not 1.
