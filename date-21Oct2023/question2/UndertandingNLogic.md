## UNDERSTANDING

I understand that there is a string of characters and for every consonent character we need to switch with nearest vowel and if character is vowel leave it as it is.

suppose if
d , a = 3
d , e = 1
and
z , a = 25

## LOGIC

- take a string to store vowels
- take a string to store result
- use nested loop to compare every character of string with the all the vowel
  - find out which is the closest then vowel
    - add the closest in resultant string
- return the resultant string
