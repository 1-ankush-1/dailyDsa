## UNDERSTANDING

The question basically says that it need to find the sum of even numbers in the given array .

## LOGIC

- we can initialise a variable with 0
- iterate the array with a loop
  - on every iteration we can check if the value at ith position is divible by 2
    - if it return true then we will add the value at ith position in sum
- after the end of the loop we will return the value of sum .
