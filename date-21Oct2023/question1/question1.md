_Magical Story: The Enchanted Array_

In a mystical land, there was a hidden forest known as Arraywood, where each tree had a magical power. These trees bore fruits, and each fruit contained a unique number. Some of these numbers were even, carrying a special enchantment that granted wishes to those who could uncover their secrets.

One day, a brave adventurer named Aria set out on a journey to discover these enchanted even numbers. Armed with her trusty array map, she embarked on a quest to find the sum of all the even numbers hidden within the forest.

As Aria ventured deeper into Arraywood, she collected fruits from various trees. Some were odd numbers, while others were even, emanating a faint, soothing glow. With determination in her heart, she carefully noted down the numbers on her array map, hoping to unveil the enchanting sum that lay ahead.

After hours of exploration, Aria returned to the edge of Arraywood with her array map filled with numbers. She carefully added up all the even numbers she had collected, feeling the magic surge within her. The forest responded with a gentle breeze, as if whispering secrets of the ancient enchantments that lay within its depths.

```
_Input:_
Array of collected fruits: [3, 8, 5, 2, 10]

_Output:_
Aria's magical sum: 20 (8 + 2 + 10)
```

As the enchanting sum revealed itself, Aria felt the energy of Arraywood coursing through her veins. The forest acknowledged her efforts and rewarded her with a shimmering token, a testament to her determination and the magic of arrays.

And so, Aria's journey through Arraywood not only uncovered the hidden even numbers but also forged a bond between her and the mystical forest, reminding her that sometimes, the most magical adventures begin with simple arrays.
