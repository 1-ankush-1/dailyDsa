"Picture yourself standing before a vast grid, akin to a canvas. Two integers, N and M, are bestowed upon you, signifying the dimensions of this gridded landscape. Your challenge is to unearth the number of unique line segments that can be etched across this expanse, adhering to a rather intriguing set of criteria. These criteria demand that the line segments stretch from one precise grid point to another, and, remarkably, the midpoint of each line segment must gracefully fall upon another of the grid's defined points.

In essence, your mission is to compute the quantity of line segments that gracefully satisfy the following prerequisites:
1. Both termini of the line segment must be anchored to specific grid points.
2. With an almost poetic elegance, the midpoint of each line segment must gracefully align itself with yet another grid point.

Your endeavor is to calculate the total number of such distinct line segments that weave this intricate dance across the grid.

Input:
The input unfurls in the form of two integers, N and M, disclosing the dimensions of this grid.

Output:
As the culmination of your quest, you shall unveil a singular integer - the count of these remarkable line segments that, against all odds, satisfy the enigmatic stipulations.

Embark on this journey and decipher the enigma of these exceptional line segments. As you embrace this challenge, remember that each line segment shall be a testament to your ingenuity in unraveling the intricacies of this gridded realm."
