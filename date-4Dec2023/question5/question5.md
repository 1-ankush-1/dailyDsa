Here's the question:
: Zero Padding

Problem Statement

Padding is a process of adding layers of zeros to the input image. If we want to have p layers of padding then we have to add p layers of zeroes on borders.

Given two integers N and p. How many zeroes are needed to be added to N X N image to give p layers of zero padding? Input

First line contains N and p.

Constraints

1 < N, p â‰¤ 10^8

Output Return a single integer denoting the required number of zeroes.

Example
