Physics-Infused Story:

In a parallel universe where the laws of physics intertwine with programming, a brilliant physicist named Dr. Elena discovered an astonishing phenomenon known as "Antonymic Spacetime Strings." These strings possessed the ability to reverse not only their characters but also the flow of time itself, unlocking a portal to a world governed by quantum entanglement.

Fascinated by the fusion of physics and programming, Dr. Elena designed a computational experiment to manipulate these Reversed Spacetime Strings. Each string was encoded with characters representing particles that resonated with specific energy levels. Reversing the string simulated an inverted timeline, enabling Dr. Elena to explore the realm of retrocausality.

However, to decode the secrets of the universe hidden within these strings, Dr. Elena needed to find the reversed string that corresponded to a specific energy configuration. To achieve this, she designed a programming puzzle based on the concept of reversing stringsâ€”a task that challenged programmers to uncover the quantum secrets concealed within the characters.

*Problem:*
Given a Reversed Spacetime String encoded with energy levels, implement a function to reverse the string and unveil its encoded message.

*Input:*
Reversed Spacetime String: "3021H5T8"

*Output:*
Decoded Message: "8T5H1023"

*Function Signature:*
javascript
function reverseSpacetimeString(inputString) {
    // Your code here
}


As Dr. Elena's fellow physicist, you're entrusted with deciphering the mysteries hidden within these strings. Your task is to implement the reverseSpacetimeString function and unlock the secrets encoded within the Reversed Spacetime String. The realm of physics and programming converge in this challenge, inviting you to explore the depths of retrocausality and quantum entanglement.
